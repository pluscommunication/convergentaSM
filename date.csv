From solar panels to batteries, we need to develop and produce clean technologies capable of harvesting and storing energy from renewable sources. We proposed the Net-Zero Industry Act to create the right conditions to attract investment and seek to produce at least 40% of the net-zero technologies Europe needs by 2030. We'll achieve this goal by: ?? Fostering investment with simpler and more predictable permitting processes. ?? Boosting demand for net-zero technologies by encouraging the inclusion of sustainability criteria in public procurement. ?? Supporting innovation with regulatory sandbox testing of new technologies. ?? Promoting skills for the net-zero technology industry via Net-Zero Industry Academies. ??Building international partnerships to promote the adoption of net-zero technologies globally. All in all, the new measures will help us become industry leaders, cut emissions, and reach climate neutrality by 2050.

In partnership with Ukraine and Poland, we are stepping up our efforts to help find these Ukrainian children by: - holding a conference to build up international pressure and take all possible measures to establish their whereabouts; - assisting UN bodies and international organisations in gathering further information on deported children, including those adopted or transferred to Russian foster families.
